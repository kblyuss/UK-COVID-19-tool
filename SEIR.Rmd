In this app we use an SEIR-type model of COVID-19 with account for: 

* **non-exponentia**l distribution of incubation and recovery periods;
* **age structure** of the population (allows to include more accurate data on age-specific rates of hospitalisation and COVID-19 related mortality).


in order to obtain more accurate estimates of disease progression and investigate different strategies for 

* **introducing** quarantine/lockdown;
* **lifting** quarantine/lockdown.

Full details of the model and its analysis are presented in (1) (**References** are at the bottom of this page).

We model the disease dynamics as follows: 

* **Susceptibles** (${\color{blue}S}$) get exposed to the disease and

* after acquiring the infection at rate ${\color{blue}\beta}$ from infected individuals, they move to 

* **Exposed** (${\color{blue}E}$) class, stay there for an incubation period ${\color{blue}{1/\nu}}$ before 

* becoming infective (either symptomatically or asymptomatically), at which point a proportion ${\color{blue}{p_A}}$ of them will **move** into 
 + **Asymptomatic** infected (${\color{blue}A}$), 
 + a proportion ${\color{blue}{p_R}}$ will move into **Infected with mild symptoms** (${\color{blue}{I_{R}}}$) not needing hospital and proceeding directly to **recovery** (${\color{blue}{R_{R}}}$)
 + a proportion ${\color{blue}{p_H}}$ will move into a class who will **need hospital** treatment (${\color{blue}{I_{H}}}$), 
 + a proportion ${\color{blue}{p_C}}$ will move into a class of those who will **need critical care** (${\color{blue}{I_{C}}}$). 

_Note: incubation period, which is the time from infection to the onset of symptoms, is taken to be the same as the latent period, which is the time from infection to becoming infectious._ 

* After recovery, characterised by an **average recovery period** ${\color{blue}{1/\gamma}}$, **Asymptomatic** individuals move into the **Recovered** class (${\color{blue}{R_{A}}}$);

* individuals in the ${\color{blue}{I_{R}}}$ group **move** into the ${\color{blue}{R_{R}}}$ class upon recovery. 

* Those who are **infected** and **require hospitalisation** move into 
 + class ${\color{blue}{H_{H}}}$ and then proceed to the 
 **Recovered** class ${\color{blue}{R_{H}}}$ after an average period of ${\color{blue}{1/\delta_{H}}}$.
 
 
* The **infected** require **critical care** ${\color{blue}{I_{C}}}$ move into 
 +  **hospitalised** class ${\color{blue}{H_{C}}}$, from which they proceed to 
 + a **critical care** class ${\color{blue}{C_C}}$ at rate ${\color{blue}{\delta_{C}}}$;
 + and subsequently they either move into 
 + the **recovered** class ${\color{blue}{R_{C}}}$ at rate ${\color{blue}{\xi_{C}}}$, 
 + or die and move to a compartment ${\color{blue}D}$ at rate ${\color{blue}\mu}$. 
 
* To include the **distributions of incubation and recovery periods** in the model, we assume that with the same mean incubation period, individuals in the **Exposed** class go through ${\color{blue}{K_1}}$ sequential stages of equal duration, and in the **Asymptomatic** and **Infected** classes they go through ${\color{blue}{K_2}}$ stages of the same duration.

* Each of the compartments is further subdivided in **18 age groups** 0-4, 5-9, ... , 85+, with population distributions for different regions taken from the data compiled by the Office for National Statistics (2). Interactions between different age groups are determined by the **mixing matrix** ${\color{blue}{C_{ij}}}$ taken as the BBC-all matrix (3,4) for baseline, and the CoMix-all matrix (5) for lockdown.

$${\color{blue}{p_{H}^i}}={\color{red}\omega^i}(1-p_{A})(1-{\color{red}\sigma^i}),$$
$${\color{blue}{p_{C}^i}}={\color{red}\sigma^i} {\color{red}\omega^i} (1-p_{A}),$$
$${\color{blue}{p_{R}^i}}=(1-p_{A})(1-{\color{red}\omega^i}).$$
Here

* ${\color{red}\omega^i}$ is the rate of hospitalisation;
* ${\color{red}\sigma^i}$ is the rate of critical care admission.

### Relating clinical observations to model parameters

To determine the model parameters consistent with current clinical data, we collect the following values from the slider values chosen by the user, and then use the formulas below to relate them to the rate parameters in the model. Note that the slider inputs for time intervals are average durations. 

* IncubPeriod:  Average incubation period, days
* RecovPeriod: Average recovery period, days
* FracAsym: Fraction of asymptomatic infections
* HospRecPer: Duration of hospital recovery for non-critical cases, days
* CritProg: Time to progress to critical care in hospital, days
* CritRec: Time to recover from critical care, days
* beta: Transmission rate

(Note g=$\gamma$, dh=$\delta_H$, dc=$\delta_C$, xic=$\xi_C$, pa=$p_A$)
```{r}
    nu=1/IncubPeriod
    
    g=1/RecovPeriod
    
    dh=1/HospRecPer
    
    dc=1/CritProg
    
    xic=1/CritRec
    
    pa=FracAsym
