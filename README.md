# Interactive COVID-19 Simulation Tool

The files in this repository produce the R Shiny application https://kblyuss.shinyapps.io/icst that models the spread of COVID-19 and its containment using a lockdown. The app allows one to choose any UK region, the timing of introduction and lifting of lockdown, as well as clinical parameters of disease transmission.

All functions for simulations are contained in the **code/functions.R** The **code** folder also contains all necessary data files, including the file with an age distribution for all UK regions, as well as all mixing matrices.
